Booklinks lets you create a bookstore with links to bookstores you specify. You can use your own affiliate codes.

== Description ==

Allows you to create books (a custom post type) with links to bookstores. On the plugin's option page, you can specify the list of bookstores you wish to use. The default list includes Amazon, B&N, Indiebound, iBooks, and Audible. You may remove any of these and add your own bookstores. On each individual book, you'll be able to toggle the display of these stores (so that you don't include a link to Audible when no audiobook is available, for example).

Originally based on MyBooks for Authors; now a mostly complete rewrite.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin through the Plugins > Add New screen, or unzip 'booklinks' to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add new books by going to Books > Add New in your admin menu

== Changelog ==

= 1.0b =
* Rewrite of MyBooks for Authors. Removed built-in bookstore list and made it totally configurable. Rewrote widget code for data sanitization and validation.
